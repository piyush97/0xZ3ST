<h1>How to start Project</h1>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-sh"><code>$ npm install # installs dependencies
$ npm run docs # this generates docs for the code in real time
# OSX only
$ open index.html # Open it directly, will use webpack to serve js bundle in future
# Others
Open index.html directly

<p>Purpose
The purpose of the document is to briefly demonstrate the end deliverables and the key features on which this project is built. It proposes to modernize the archaic game of ‘Treasure Hunt’ and bring it to the realm of metaverse using trailblazing technology like augmented reality. This game falls under the genre of Infotainment and Adventure. It has question centric navigational game flow. Users with their smartphones would be able to reach real life locations and scan the markers for questions to pop on their screens. Answering those questions would take them on a quest to find further treasures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overview
Generally, Infotainment category games are not known for their amusement quotient, in order to rectify this problem, we have introduced the AR feature to our game. This game would challenge users on multiple levels which include their general awareness, also this would require them to be present in person to interact with their local surroundings through their smartphones. The real life interaction and the augmented reality features increase the entertainment and engagement quotients of the game exponentially. Furthermore, this game will also increase the in-person coordination of the users amongst their peers while solving the adventure of treasure hunt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scope
Considering the target audience mainly consisting of young users , the platform for the game should be a cross platform app which is supported on all kinds of smartphones. Our game will act as an ice breaker amongst users and would be a great team building tool. It won’t only have level progression based on correct answers, the end-to-end engaging flow would be ensured. If in a scenario where the user is stuck in answering questions, they can access the progressive hints to traverse further in game. Moreover, in future scope the earned coins (Z3ST coins) will have tangible real world monetary value which users can use to upgrade and unlock new features within the game. They can even use these coins to purchase real world products just like any other crypto currency.</p>
